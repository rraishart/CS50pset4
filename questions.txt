0.  BMP - 32 bits and 4,294,967,296 colors
    GIF - 8 bits and 256 colors
    JPEG - 256 colors out of 16 million possible
    PNG - up to 48 bit
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression makes compressed files lose some data after uncompressing. 
    Lossless keeps all the original data after uncompressing.
3.  JPEG
4.  Deleting a file on FAT usually just rewrites the pointer data for the file.
5.  I can physically destroy the hard drive after I delete said files.
6.  stdint.h is a header file containing definitions of different types.
7.  You use these types to ensure unity in size of type across different operating systems.
8.  BYTE is 1 byte. DWORD is 4 bytes. LONG is 4 bytes. WORD is 2 bytes.
9.  All BMP files must start with 0x424D.
10. bfSize is the size of the bitmap file and biSize is the size of the structure.
11. It means the bitmap is top-down and starts in the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount specifies the color depth.
13. It might return NULL because it does not have access to the file.
14. It only has '1' as its third arguement because it's always reading 1 object.
15. padding is assigned the value '3'.
16. fSeek sets the file position for the stream it is passed as an arguement.
17. SEEK_CUR is an origin value to be passed to fseek signifying that you start padding from the current location.
